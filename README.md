# React-Boiler

A bare bones react boilerplate to get up and running with react projects

It has webpack configurations in place for development and production.

### Setting it up

- Make sure you have node running on your system (easy way to check this is running `node -v` and if you see a version you have node), if you don't have node setup you can setup [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) which also helps you manage versions.
- Once you have nvm, make sure you use node v10.16.3
- Make sure you have [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) setup. 
- To install dependencies, run `yarn install` in the directory.
- To run development build, run `yarn start`
- To generate a production bundle, run `yarn build`, this will generate a bundle in the build folder.
